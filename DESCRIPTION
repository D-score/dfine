Description: Tools to define uni-dimensional measurement scales 
    for child development, dedicated to cleaning, refining, and modeling binary
    responses to developmental milestones. The package supports data from 
    multiple instruments and sources, and provides functionality to define, 
    estimate, evaluate, and extend statistical models for establishing a 
    quantitative scale of early childhood development. By setting a solid 
    foundation, dfine enables meaningful comparison and integration of data 
    across diverse contexts, paving the way for a globally accepted measurement
    scale independent of specific instruments.
